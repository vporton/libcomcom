Support for stderr.

If the called program closed its stdout but not yet exited, return its output
immediately, because in this situation it makes no sense to wait for it to
terminate. Implementing this feature, be careful not to confuse SIGCHLD of
different processes.

SIGKILL for the subprocess if: a. it timeouts; b. poll() returns -1.

Asynchronous communication with the spawned process.

Pass old SIGCHLD handler in struct sigaction. Use it both to be called from our
handler and to restore the old handler upon de-initialization.
WARNING: Old handler obtained by sigaction() may be unspecified if the last
handler was assigned by signal() (not sigaction()).

Reduce the number of realloc() calls by allocating buffers with a reserve.
