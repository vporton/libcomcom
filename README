* Command Communication Library *

Spawn an OS command with given input and receive its output.

The main feature of this library is deadlock avoidance.
(Deadlock in this case is when your program can't write to the input
of another program because of waiting for its output which does not
happen because of no input, so a vicious circle leading to infinite
waiting time.)

API docs:
https://vporton.github.io/libcomcom-docs/

The current version is alpha.

Related software http://libpipeline.nongnu.org (seem NOT to support
deadlock avoidance).

WARNING: The current version of this library does not work on Windows
because it uses `fork()` function. (However, it probably works with
Cygwin and/or WSL, not tested.)

Visual Studio.
