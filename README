* Command Communication Library *

Spawn an OS command with given input and receive its output.

The main feature of this library is deadlock avoidance.
(Deadlock in this case is when your program can't write to the input
of another program because of waiting for its output which does not
happen because of no input, so a vicious circle leading to infinite
waiting time.)

The current version is alpha.

deadlock avoidance).
